; Roadshow example script for cardInfo.
; v1.1 by Chris Jones <cmsj@tenshu.net>
;
; Add network interfaces dynamically to Roadshow based on which PCMCIA NICs
;  are present at runtime.
;
; This script can be called from S:User-startup after S:Network-Startup, or
;  you can call it from S:Network-Startup if you need the interfaces to
;  come up before some daemons get started by that script.
;
; Roadshow's S:Network-Startup will still unconditionally add any interfaces
;  defined in DEVS:NetInterfaces/ so you should move any non-permanent NICs
;  from there to SYS:Storage/NetInterfaces. See the examples below for how
;  to add an interface from SYS:Storage.
;
; Also note that if you have a WiFi driver installed, you will probably need
;  to remove its entry from S:User-startup and add it to this script (see the
;  Prism2 example below)

; Fail at return code 20.
; If there is no card, or some other driver/task owns the card, the first call
;  to cardInfo will return 20 and we can avoid running the rest of the script.

  ; WirelessManager needs to establish the wireless connection before
  ;  we call AddNetInterface, so wait for 2 seconds. This may need to be
  ;  adjusted for your machine.
